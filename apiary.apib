# Getting Started
***

This guide will walk you through how to use Simkl API on your website, media server app, browser extension or in your mobile app. 


## Before You Start
To successfully start using Simkl API, you need to:

1. **[Sign up for a Simkl account](https://passport.simkl.com/register/)**.
2. **[Create a new app in your account](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/new/)** to get your API key (`client_id`).
3. **[Join the Discord Server to chat](https://discord.gg/MJsWNE4)**
<br><br>Join the [community](https://discord.gg/MJsWNE4) to talk, learn about and discuss the Simkl APIs. Or DM directly on Discord.

## Requirements
### 1. When using the API, a link is required back to https://simkl.com/ or directly to an item related to the API request. If not sure how to implement, let us know at support@simkl.com or DM directly on Discord.
### 2. The Simkl API is not authorized for use in conjunction with other competing services of the same nature if your service or app does not provide Simkl login and Sync functionality with Simkl, including but not limited to TV, Movie, Anime, Manga list/tracker services. If you are interested in using this service within your own application or website, please contact us at though our Discord and we will be happy to discuss it further!
What this means is that you cannot use parts of the API that don't involve tracking unless you integrate the option to sync with Simkl, especially if your app already has sync functionality with other trackers.
### 3. Please use TVDB, TMDB API from their original sources if your need metadata API.
### 4. If you're using Github, it is important to hide your Client-ID and secrets in [Github Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) to avoid any API request limit issues.
### 5. Free for non-commercial use. (See commercial usage below).

The Simkl API can be used within commercial applications or services that generate less than $150 per month in revenue free of charge, without explicitly requesting permission.
Any application or service that generates more than $150 in revenue per month must obtain a commercial license. Those who wish to acquire a commercial license or more information regarding commercial API usage may reach us through the Discord server. 

Running the API inside your app with large amount of requests costs us fees in DNS, Routing, Health checks, CDN, Server Hosting, Failover backups and Server management so if you have large amount of requests you need to be able to cover them financially.

## How to use the API
1. Get user's `token` using [OAuth](/#reference/authentication-oauth-2.0) or [PIN Authentication](/#reference/authentication-pin) and save it on user's device.
2. Post API requests with the user's `token` and your API Key (`client_id`)

# About Simkl API
***

All API access is over HTTPS. All responses are returned as JSON. The API is (mostly) RESTful.<br>
Please [contact us](http://support.simkl.com) if you're interested in an API we don't yet support.


Here's what you need to know to get started quickly:

## Use Cases
The Simkl API lets you build a variety of applications and scripts to integrate Simkl with your apps, show Simkl data in other contexts, and update your watch history from various locations.

Here are some examples of the things you can build with the Simkl API:

- A browser extension to quickly mark as watched or add to your watchlist from any web page.
- A Movie, TV or Anime app for iOS or Android.
- Plugin for your favorite media center app to sync your watch history with Simkl.

## Api URL
`https://api.simkl.com/`
## Verbs
HTTP Verb|Description
---|----
`GET`| Retrieve the item.  Success returns `200` status code.
`POST`| Create a new item.  Success returns `201` status code.
`DELETE`| Delete the item. Success returns `200` or `204` status code.

## HTTP Status Codes
The Simkl API attempts to return appropriate HTTP status codes for every request.

Code|Text|Description
---|---|----
`200`| OK | Success!
`201`| OK | Success - *new resource created (POST)*
`204`| OK | Success - *no content to return (DELETE)*
`302`| Found | Redirected to correct URL
`400`| Bad Request | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further.
`401`| Unauthorized | [Authentication credentials](#reference/authentication-oauth-2.0) were missing or incorrect.
`403`| Forbidden | The request is understood, but it has been refused or access is not allowed. An accompanying error message will explain why. This code is used whe using invalid API key or unapproved app or requests are being denied due to API limits.
`404`| Not Found | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested. Also returned when the requested format is not supported by the requested method.
`405`| Not Found | *[IN_DEV]*
`409`| Unauthorized | *[IN_DEV]* Conflict - resource already created

`429`| *[IN_DEV]* | Rate Limit Exceeded
`500`| Internal Server Error | Something is broken. Please post to the [developer discord](https://discord.gg/MJsWNE4) so the Simkl team can investigate.
`502`| Bad Gateway | Simkl is down or being upgraded.
`503`| Service Unavailable | The Simkl servers are up, but overloaded with requests. Try again later.

## Required Headers
When making API calls you'lll need to send some headers to identify your app.

Header|Value
---|----
`Content-Type` * | `application/json`
`simkl-api-key` * | Your `client_id` listed under [your Simkl applications](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/).

## Full Info

By default methods are not returnig additional data for movies, anime, show etc. They return minimal info you need to match in the local database. But, if you need more information just add `extended={fields}` to the URL.

*Fields*|*Description*
---|---|----
`full`| Complete info, except `discover` endpoints
`title`,`slug`,`overview`,`metadata`,`theater`,`genres`,`tmdb`| Possible comma separated values for the <b>Discover</b> endpoints. <br> `theater` value requires `&user-country=us` variable, otherwise US country will be taken.

## Dates
[In Development] Currently dates are returned as (GMT - 05:00 New York time zone)

All dates will be GMT and returned in the ISO 8601 format like `2015-03-15T15:30:11Z`. Adjust 
accordingly in your app for the user's local timezone.

## Pagination
Some of our endpoints are paginated. Endpoints which have 📄 Pagination will load 1 page of 10 items by default. If you want to change this, append query string `?page={page}&limit={limit}` to the URL

Parameter|Type|Default|Value
---|---|---|---
`page`|integer|1|Number of page
`limit`|integer|10|Results per page

additionally, all paginated endpoints will return these HTTP headers as well
Header|Value
-|-
X-Pagination-Page|Current page
X-Pagination-Limit|Items per page
X-Pagination-Page-Count|Total number of pages
X-Pagination-Item-Count|Total number of items

## Images
Use `https://wsrv.nl/?url=https://simkl.in` domain for images.

It is preffered to use https://wsrv.nl/ service to minimise traffic to our servers. As an extra bonus WSRV provides options to resize and cut images as you need them.

We have different types of images, choose the one that best suits your needs.

### Caching images
It is required that you cache images in your app or server by `image_url` forever. The images with the same URL never change. Do not redownload the same image multiple times.

## Standard Media Objects

All methods will accept or return standard media objects for `movie`, `show`, `episode` items. 

Anime can has `anime_type` with possible values `tv|movie|special|ova|ona|music video`.

Here are examples for all objects:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td align="center" valign="top"><strong>movie</strong></td>

<br><br>

# Group Authentication - OAuth 2.0
There's no reinventing the wheel here so the API uses OAuth2. 

Requesting user associated information requires `token` that needs to be included in all request headers made to the API.


To obtain the `client_id` and `client_secret` please [create an app first](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/new/). 


To make calls on behalf of a user you have to obtain an `access_token`. To do this, first use **https://simkl.com/oauth/authorize** method to get `code` and then post it in JSON format to **https://api.simkl.com/oauth/token** url. In response you'll get the `access_token`.
For more details see Authorize and Token sections below.

  **So STEP  1 for OAuth - Open the URL that looks like this in your Browser or in a Custom Tab (do not use WebView) on mobile device from your app:**
  
+ Request https://simkl.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=c7be48f1559a6d794w1925237c626326c7bsdfsa559a6d794w1925137c626316&redirect_uri=http://yourdomain.com/oauth.html
        
        
+ Response 200

It will redirect back to your website or app URL with `?code` at the end of your Redirect URL.


## Authorize [/oauth/authorize{?response_type,client_id,redirect_uri,state}]

### Authorize Application [GET]
Redirect a user to this URL. There the user will grant permissions for you app and if everything is fine you'll get a `code` which you can exchange for `access_token`. 
Once you have an access token you can use it to make calls on behalf of a user.

**Note:** You should use the https://simkl.com domain when creating this URL and not the API URL.

+ Parameters
    + response_type (string, `code`) ... must be "code"
    + client_id (string) ... Get this from your app settings
    + redirect_uri (string, `http://yourdomain.com/oauth.html`) ...  [URI in your app settings](https://simkl.com/settings/developer/)
    + state (optional, string, `state`) ... your custom variable

+ Request https://simkl.com/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=c7be48f1559a6d794w1925237c626326c7bsdfsa559a6d794w1925137c626316&redirect_uri=http://yourdomain.com/oauth.html

    + Body

+ Response 200

    + Body

## Token [/oauth/token]
### Exchange code for access_token [POST]
**STEP 2:** The redirect to your application in the step above will include a `code` parameter which you can exchange for an `access_token` using this method. 

Save the `access_token` somewhere safe. From that moment your app can authenticate the user by sending the `Authorization` header.

<h4>JSON POST DATA</h4>
Key|Type|Value
---|----|-----
code|string|code you've get from authorize method
client_id|string|Get this in your app settings
client_secret|string|Get this in your app settings
redirect_uri|string|Your URI in your app settings 
grant_type|string|`authorization_code`

`access_token` do not have expiration date (Never expire).

`access_token` can be deleted by user when revoking app access rights in [Connected Apps settings](https://simkl.com/settings/connected-apps/).

+ Request (application/json)

        {
            "code"          : "d7be48f1559a6d794w1925237c626326c7dddfsa559a6d794w1925137c626313",
            "client_id"     : "c7be48f1559a6d794w1925237c626326c7bsdfsa559a6d794w1925137c626352",
            "client_secret" : "a9be48f1529a2d794w1925237c626326c7dddfsa559a6d794w1925137c626321",
            "redirect_uri"  : "http://yourdomain.com/oauth.html",
            "grant_type"    : "authorization_code"
        }
+ Response 200 (application/json)
Valid `code` will generate you the `access_token`
    + Body

            { 
                "access_token"  : "b5be48f1529a2d794f1925237c626326c7dddfsa559a6d794w1925137c622329",
                "token_type"    : "bearer", 
                "scope"         : "public"
            }
+ Response 401 (application/json)
Invalid code will give you a 401 error
    + Body

            { 
                "error"  : "grant_error"
            }
        

# Group Authentication - PIN
This flow is designed for devices that have limited input capabilities, such as media center plugins, game consoles, smart watches, smart TVs, command line scripts, and system services, etc.
Your app displays an alphanumeric code (typically 5 characters) to the user. They are then instructed to visit the verification URL on their computer or mobile device. After entering the code, the user will be prompted to grant permission for your app. After your app gets permissions, the device receives an access_token and works like standard OAuth from that point on.

You should do the following step to authorize user's device:

1. [Request a device code](#reference/authentication-pin/request-a-device-code/get-code).

2. Display `user_code` and instruct the user to visit the [`verification_url`](https://simkl.com/pin/).
<img src="https://us.simkl.in/img_tv/api_demo_pin.png" alt="Simkl PIN" width="779" height="479"/>

3. [Begin polling Simkl's authorization server](#reference/authentication-pin/get-code-status/check-user_code).

4. User enters `user_code` at  the [`verification_url`](https://simkl.com/pin/) on their computer or mobile device.

5. Simkl returns `access_token` to the device where the polling is in progress. Your app will be polling to see if the user successfully authorizes your app. Use `expires_in` to stop polling after that many seconds, and gracefully instruct the user to restart the process. **It is important to poll at the correct interval and also stop polling when expired**.

6. Once they have, refresh your UI to indicate a successful connection has been made. 

## Request a device code [/oauth/pin{?client_id,redirect}]

### Get CODE [GET]
 
In response you'll get `user_code` and `verification_url` (in most cases [https://simkl.com/pin/](https://simkl.com/pin/)) which should be displayed to the user. Store `expires_in` and `interval` values for step 3.

<h4>JSON POST DATA</h4>
Key|Type|Value
---|----|-----
client_id|string|Get this in your app settings

+ Parameters
    + client_id (string, `***`) ... Get this from your app settings
    + redirect (string,optional,`http://yourdomain.com/welcome`) ... URL where you want to redirect user when he approved you application
            
+ Response 200 (application/json)

    + Body
    
            { 
                'result': 'OK', 
                'device_code': DEVICE_CODE, 
                'user_code': USER_CODE, 
                'verification_url': https://simkl.com/pin/, 
                'expires_in': 900, 
                'interval': 5 
            }

## Get CODE status [/oauth/pin/{USER_CODE}{?client_id}]

### Check USER_CODE [GET]

Application can poll this url to get `USER_CODE` status or `ACCESS_TOKEN`. Returned interval in step 1 response specifies the minimum amount of time(seconds), that your app should wait between polling requests.

+ Parameters
    + client_id (string, `***`) ... Get this from your app settings
    + USER_CODE (string) ... Get this from previous step
            
+ Response 200 (application/json)

    + Body
    
            { 
                'result': 'KO', 
                'message': 'Authorization pending'
            }

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    + Body
    
            { 
                'result': 'KO', 
                'message': 'Slow down'

# Group Calendar
Simkl provides separate JSON data calendar files that can be used to display the "Upcoming", "Next", "Schedule" or "Calendar" sections in your app or within show details cards.    

The calendar files are generated every 6 hours and are cached on a CDN for 5 hours *(you can check the last-modified HTTP Headers for the file generation date)*.     

The files URLs ignore all query strings, so **do not add** any additional parameters (such as **``?random=***``**).

<h3>How to use calendar data</h3>
You can use the calendar data to create lists of upcoming episodes, premieres (e.g. S01E01), or movies by combining it with your existing lists or using the user lists obtained from the [Sync](/#reference/sync) endpoints.  

**Example:** When a user opens their watchlist, you can add the calendar data to show that the next episode will air in 3 days, without the need to re-sync the user's list. **Simply get fresh calendar files and cache them for 3-6 hours on the user's device.**

<h2>List of Calendar Data Files</h2>
<h3>Airing Next</h3>
Find out when the next episodes or movie releases are happening:

https://data.simkl.in/calendar/tv.json    
https://data.simkl.in/calendar/anime.json    
https://data.simkl.in/calendar/movie_release.json    

**The calendar files contain episode airing dates (for TV, Anime) and theater release dates (for Movies) for the previous day as well as the next 33 days.**

<h3>Monthly Calendar Data Files</h3>
We update calendars for the past 12 months every 24 hours, and for the current month every 6 hours.

**Examples for January 2024:**

https://data.simkl.in/calendar/2024/1/tv.json    
https://data.simkl.in/calendar/2024/1/anime.json    
https://data.simkl.in/calendar/2024/1/movie_release.json    

All calendar items have Simkl rank and ratings, [poster images](/#introduction/about-simkl-api/images), as well as SIMKL, TVDB, TMDB, IMDB, and MAL IDs where available.

# Group Checkin
Mobile apps can do checkin manually. If you are curretlty watching a movie or an episode you can simply do checkin from your phone or tablet and the episode will be automatically marked as watched in 15-40 minutes (based on the episode\movie lenth).

If you wish to instantly mark episode\movie as watched please use [Sync, Add to History method](/#reference/sync/add-to-history/check-into-an-item)

## Checkin [/checkin]

### Check into an item [GET]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>
This should be tied to a user manual action. The item will be as watching on the site and if the time has elapsed it will switch to completed. 

Pass as much data as possible into the item including `title`, `year` and `ids` fields so Simkl could detect the item better.

<h4>JSON POST DATA</h4>
Key|Type|Value
---|----|-----
item*|object|[episode or movie object](/#introduction/about-simkl-api/standard-media-objects).

<b>Note</b>: If there is checkin in progress, 409 code will be returned and response will contain an expires_at datetime when you will be able to ckeckin again.

## Ratings by Watchlist [/ratings{/type}{?user_watchlist,fields,client_id}]

### Get ratings for the watchlist's items [GET]

<h4>&#128275; Token Required</h4>

#### When to use it:
Use this endpoint when you need updated ratings or release status for **items in a user’s watchlist**. For example, cached data from `/sync/` can change over time if show airing statuses or movie release information are updated.


#### What you can fetch:
- Ratings and statuses for movies, TV shows, and anime in a user’s watchlist.  
- Filter by list type (`all`,`watching`, `plantowatch`, `completed`, `dropped`, `hold`).  
- Current release status for each item (e.g., ongoing, released, ended).

It is highly recommended to  cache data for ended TV/anime shows and released movies (or items in the Completed list) for longer periods, as their average ratings and statuses rarely change.
> possible `fields` values: `simkl,link,ext,rank,release_status,year`

# Group Redirect

## Redirect to Simkl, trailer or Twitter [/redirect{?to,title,year,season,episode,client_id}]
In situations when you want to link directly to the Movie or TV show episode on Simkl from your Website or APP but don't know Simkl URL, you can use the  Redirect API.
Redirect users directly to **Simkl** page,  **Trailer** or to **Twitter** (to Share a Simkl link on Twitter with prefilled data).

### Use Cases

Here are some examples of the things you can build with the Redirect API:

- A browser extension to quickly link to Simkl based on page content.
- A website page linking directly to Simkl based on IMDB ID or TV Show name.
- Link to a trailer knowing only Movie name and year.
- Share an episode on Twitter from your browser extension.
- Get all Simkl IDs for your own API.

### Redirect [GET]
<h4>&#128275; Token Required</h4>
<h4>&#128274; client_id Not Required</h4>
Use this if you want to make a redirect to Simkl or (fast post) to Twitter using show's title or id. It will return "location" header.

# Group Scrobble
Scrobbling lets apps report real-time playback progress. Use it when a user starts, pauses, or stops watching. If you want to instantly mark an item as watched without scrobbling, use [Sync - add to history](#reference/sync/add-items-to-the-history).

Pass as much data as possible (title, year, ids) so Simkl can detect the item reliably.

Progress is a percentage from 0.00 to 100.00 (input format: flexible, max 2 decimal places, e.g., `75`, `75.0`, `75.12`; response format: standardized, e.g., `75`, `75.12`, `45.5`).
Scrobble id is a 64bit integer

## Overview
Simkl stores only **one active scrobble session per show/movie/anime**. Starting a new session replaces any existing one for that item and clears previous pauses. Paused sessions (created by `/scrobble/pause` or `/scrobble/stop` with <80% progress) can be retrieved via [Get Playbacks](#reference/sync/playback/get-playback-sessions) and resumed by calling `/scrobble/start` with the same item. To delete a paused session, use [Delete Playback](#reference/sync/playback/delete-playback).

**Typical Flow:**
1. Call `/scrobble/start` when playback begins.
2. Call `/scrobble/pause` to save progress if paused.
3. Call `/scrobble/stop` when finished (marks as watched if ≥80% complete).
4. If activity endpoint has `playback` updated, retrieve paused sessions with `/sync/playback/{type}`.
5. Delete unwanted paused sessions with `DELETE /sync/playback/{id}`.

> Members can view and manage their saved playbacks at [https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/](https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/).


**Action Types in Responses:**
- `"start"` - Returned by `/scrobble/start` when beginning or resuming playback
- `"pause"` - Returned by `/scrobble/pause` or `/scrobble/stop` when progress < 80%
- `"scrobble"` - Returned by `/scrobble/stop` when progress ≥ 80% (marks as watched)

**Session Management:**
- **Expiry timestamps**: Start sessions get expiry = current time + remaining runtime; stop sessions get expiry = current time + 1 hour; pause sessions get expiry = current time
- **Persistence**: All sessions persist in the playback until manually removed (no automatic cleanup) or until replaced by next scrobble update for that title, and are retained based on the user&#39;s subscription plan: Free (7 days), PRO (30 days), VIP (90 days)
- **Rate limiting**: One scrobble operation per user at a time (20-second lock timeout)
- **Duplicate prevention**: 409 response if trying to stop an already completed session within 1 hour

Note: in Sync playback responses, `progress` is returned as a percentage (float number from 0 to 100, e.g., `0`, `45.5`, `75`, `100`). While you can POST `75.00`, the response will always be `75`.

**Anime Episode Numbering:** Simkl uses AniDB as the primary source for anime data, which has different season/episode numbering than TMDB/TVDB. When you send anime scrobbles using TMDB season/episode numbers, Simkl maps them to the corresponding AniDB episode numbers. The response includes both the Simkl\AniDB episode numbers (`season`, `number`) and the original TVDB numbers (`tvdb_season`, `tvdb_number`) for reference. For example, TMDB Season 2 Episode 4 might map to Simkl\AniDB Season 1 Episode 4, as shown in the anime examples below.

Either `movie`, `show` + `episode`, or `anime` + `episode` objects are required.

## Start [/scrobble/start]
### Start watching [POST]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>
Creates or replaces the current scrobble session for the user and item. Sets the user's internal "watching now" status. Call this when playback begins or to resume a paused session. The response includes the `progress` sent in the request, returned as a float.

**When to use:** On video start, or to resume from a paused session (retrieved via [Get Playbacks](#reference/sync/playback/get-playback-sessions)). The session auto-ends after the item's runtime elapses if no pause/stop is called.

**Behavior:** Replaces any existing session for this item and clears previous pauses. Does not mark the item as watched. Session auto-expires after calculated runtime based on item length and current progress.

## Pause [/scrobble/pause]
### Pause watching [POST]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>
Pauses an active scrobble session and saves the current progress to the database for later resumption. The response includes the `progress` sent in the request, returned as a float.

**When to use:** Call when the user pauses playback to save progress without marking as watched. This creates a paused session that can be retrieved later via [Get Playbacks](#reference/sync/playback/get-playback-sessions).

**Behavior:** Adds a pause event to the DB. Does not mark the item as watched. The paused session can be resumed by calling `/scrobble/start` with the same item.

## Stop [/scrobble/stop]
### Stop watching [POST]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>

Stops the current scrobble session and marks the item as watched if progress is ≥80%, otherwise saves it as a paused session. The response includes the `progress` sent in the request, returned as a float.

**When to use:** Call when playback ends. If progress `>= 80%`, the item is marked as watched. If `progress < 80%`, it behaves like a pause (saves progress for later resumption).

**Behavior:** If `>= 80%` complete, adds to watch history and marks as watched. If `< 80%`, creates a paused session (like `/scrobble/pause`). Prevents duplicate scrobbles within an hour (409 response). Stop sessions expire after 1 hour.

# Group Sync

Simkl can be one central place where you store all your watch history. Syncing allows all your devices and apps have your watch history up to date. Use Simkl as your a cloud backup for all your Media history.


<h3>Get All Items</h3>
This is a list of all your movies, shows and episodes that you watched or have in your Plan to Watch list.

To start a sync first check the last activities of the user and then do an update only if the date in one of them have changed scince your last check.

## How to Use Sync [/sync/how-to-use-sync]

**How to properly use `date_from` together with the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">Last Activities</a> and <a href="#reference/sync/get-all-items">Get All Items</a>
 endpoints**

To efficiently synchronize a user's watch history with your application using the Simkl API, you should leverage the `date_from` parameter in conjunction with the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> endpoint. This allows you to fetch only the data that has changed since your last sync, reducing data transfer and processing time. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to implement this:

### **1. Initial Sync (First Request)**

**a. Call the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">Last Activities</a> Endpoint**

Begin by making a request to the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> endpoint to retrieve the latest activity timestamps for the user. This endpoint provides timestamps for various categories and media types, indicating the last time each was updated.

**Request:**

```http
POST https://api.simkl.com/sync/activities
Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer [token]
    simkl-api-key: [client_id]
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
    "all": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z",
    "settings": {
        "all": "2023-10-10T09:17:15Z"
    },
    "tv_shows": {
        "all": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z",
        "rated_at": "2023-10-11T08:00:00Z",
        "playback": "2024-10-11T08:00:00Z",
        "plantowatch": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z",
        "watching": "2023-10-10T07:00:00Z",
        "completed": "2023-10-09T06:00:00Z",
        "hold": null,
        "dropped": "2023-10-08T05:00:00Z",
        "removed_from_list": "2023-10-07T04:00:00Z"
    },
    "anime": {
        "all": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z",
        "rated_at": "2023-10-10T08:00:00Z",
        "playback": "2024-10-11T08:00:00Z",
        "plantowatch": "2023-10-11T09:03:45Z",
        "watching": "2023-10-09T07:00:00Z",
        "completed": "2023-10-08T06:00:00Z",
        "hold": null,
        "dropped": "2023-10-07T05:00:00Z",
        "removed_from_list": "2023-10-06T04:00:00Z"
    },
    "movies": {
        "all": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z",
        "rated_at": "2023-10-11T08:00:00Z",
        "playback": "2024-10-11T08:00:00Z",
        "plantowatch": "2023-10-10T09:03:45Z",
        "completed": "2023-10-09T07:00:00Z",
        "dropped": "2023-10-08T06:00:00Z",
        "removed_from_list": "2023-10-07T05:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

**b. Save the Timestamps**

Store all the datetime values from the response in your application's local or cloud storage. These timestamps will be used to determine changes in the user's data during subsequent syncs.

**c. Fetch All Data Without `date_from`**

Since this is the first sync and you have no prior data, you need to retrieve the entire watchlist.

**Request:**

```http
GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/all-items/
Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer [token]
    simkl-api-key: [client_id]
```

**Response:**

The API will return all items (movies, shows, anime) that the user has in their watchlist. Process and store this data in your application as the baseline for future syncs.

---

### **2. Subsequent Syncs (Further Requests)**

**a. Periodically Check for Updates**

After some time, check the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> endpoint for any changes. You can compare the dates from this endpoint with your locally saved copy. You may compare any specific date you need (e.g., `movies.completed`, `tv_shows.watching`) or just the main `all` date (`"all": "2023-10-12T09:03:45Z"`).

To keep your app's data current, periodically check the <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> endpoint for changes. Here are optimal times to perform this check:

- **When the User Opens the App:** Sync immediately to ensure the latest data is displayed.
- **When the App Becomes Active:** If the app was in the background, check for updates when it becomes active again.
- **At Regular Intervals:** For apps that stay open, consider syncing every few hours to keep data fresh.

By syncing during these key moments, your app stays up-to-date without unnecessary API calls.


**Request:**

```http
POST https://api.simkl.com/sync/activities
Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer [token]
    simkl-api-key: [client_id]
```

**b. Compare Timestamps**

Compare the new timestamps received with the ones you previously saved.

- **If a Timestamp Has Changed:** This indicates that data in that category has been updated since your last sync.
- **If a Timestamp Has Not Changed:** No action is needed for that category.

**Note:** Depending on your application's requirements, you can choose to monitor specific timestamps that are relevant to your data synchronization needs, or you can rely on the main `"all"` timestamp for a broader check.

**c. Use `date_from` Parameter for Updates**

For each category where the timestamp has changed, use the `date_from` parameter in your requests to fetch only the updated data.

**Request Example for Updated Shows:**

```http
GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/all-items/shows/?date_from=2023-10-10T07:00:00Z
Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer [token]
    simkl-api-key: [client_id]
```

- **`date_from` Value:** Use the saved timestamp from your last sync for that specific category.

**d. Process Updated Data**

Update your local data store with the items received:

- **Add New Items:** Include any new shows, movies, or episodes added.
- **Update Existing Items:** Reflect changes in status, ratings, or watched episodes.
- **Remove Deleted Items:** If the `removed_from_list` timestamp has changed, identify and remove items that are no longer in the user's watchlist.

**Handling Removals:**

If items were removed, you might need to call `/sync/all-items/` without `date_from` only with `extended=simkl_ids_only` or `extended=ids_only` to get the full current list (mini watchlist with IDs only) and compare it with your local data to determine which items have been removed.

**e. Update Saved Timestamps**

After processing the updates, overwrite your saved timestamps with the new ones from the latest <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> response. This ensures your next sync will use the correct `date_from` values.

---

### **3. Detailed Steps with Examples**

#### **First Sync:**

1. **Call <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> and Save Timestamps**

   ```http
   POST https://api.simkl.com/sync/activities
   ```

   Save the entire response.

2. **Fetch All Items Without `date_from`**

   ```http
   GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/all-items/
   ```

   Process and store the data locally.



#### **Subsequent Syncs:**

###### 1. **Call <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a>**

   ```http
   POST https://api.simkl.com/sync/activities
   ```
###### 2. **Compare Timestamps**

   Compare each timestamp with the saved ones.

   - **Example:** If `movies.rated_at` has changed from `2023-10-11T08:00:00Z` to `2023-10-12T09:00:00Z` (compared to your saved copy), you need to fetch updated movie ratings.

###### 3. **Fetch Updates with `date_from`**

   For updated categories, make requests like:

   ```http
   GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/all-items/movies/?date_from=2023-10-11T08:00:00Z
   ```

###### 4. **Process Updates**

   - **Add or Update Items:** Incorporate new data into your local store.
   - **Remove Items:** If `removed_from_list` has changed, fetch the full list and remove items not present.

###### 5. **Update Saved Timestamps**

   Replace old timestamps with the new ones from the latest <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> response.

---

### **4. Handling Specific Scenarios**

**Ratings Updates:**

- If `rated_at` has changed, use `/sync/ratings` with `date_from` to get the latest ratings.

  **Request:**

  ```http
  GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/ratings/?date_from=2023-10-11T08:00:00Z
  Headers:
      Authorization: Bearer [token]
      simkl-api-key: [client_id]
  ```

**Note on Automatic Moves:**

- When a user rates an item not in their list, it may automatically move to `Completed` or `Watching`. However, the `completed_at` timestamp may not update. Always check ratings when `rated_at` changes.

**Use of Extended Parameters:**

- When needing detailed information (e.g., watched episodes), use `extended=full` and `episode_watched_at=yes`:

  ```http
  GET https://api.simkl.com/sync/all-items/shows/?extended=full&episode_watched_at=yes&date_from=2023-10-10T07:00:00Z
  Headers:
      Authorization: Bearer [token]
      simkl-api-key: [client_id]
  ```

- **Caution:** These parameters increase response size. Always use them with `date_from` to minimize data transfer.

---

### **5. Tips and Best Practices**

- **Time Zones:** All timestamps are in UTC. Convert them appropriately if your application operates in a different time zone.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for network issues or unexpected responses.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that your local data store accurately reflects the user's data on Simkl after each sync.
- **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of API rate limits. Avoid excessive calls by scheduling syncs appropriately.

---

### **6. Summary**

By following these steps, you ensure that:

- Your application stays up-to-date with the user's Simkl watch history.
- Data transfer is minimized by only fetching changes since the last sync.
- The user experiences seamless synchronization without unnecessary delays or data usage.


### Example Workflow Recap [GET]

1. **First Sync:**
   - Save all timestamps from <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a>.
   - Fetch all items without `date_from`.
   - Store data locally.

2. **Further Syncs:**
   - Call <a href="#reference/sync/last-activities">`/sync/activities`</a> to get new timestamps.
   - Compare with saved timestamps.
   - For each changed category:
     - Use the relevant saved timestamp as `date_from` in `/sync/all-items/` request.
     - Process and update local data.
   - Update saved timestamps for the next sync.
   
  
By properly using `date_from` with the activity endpoint and comparing the specific dates you need or just the main `"all"` date, you optimize your application's performance and provide a better experience for your users.

## Last Activities [/sync/activities]
### Get last activity [POST]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>

When syncing it's best to check user's last activity first. Then you'll be able to sync only the watchlists that have changed since the last sync. 

This method will decrease sync time or minimize wait time to zero if nothing changed so you do not need to download user's full history every time.

<b>NOTE:</b> when user rates the movie, tv show or anime and it is not in his list, it will be automatically moved to `Completed`, `Watching` depending on it's type(movie or serie)

<h4>Fields definition and HOWTO</h4>
Name|Description
---|----
`all`| latest update time within the category, use it as first check
`settings`| any update in https://simkl.com/settings/ will trigger update time. For example when user changes his name or time zone.
`rated_at` | If updated, use the <i>Get Ratings</i> endpoint with the <i>date_from</i> parameter to retrieve the latest rating updates or deletions.<br><br><b>CAUTION!</b> When a user rates a movie, it will be automatically moved to "Completed". If a user rates a TV show and it's not in the user’s watchlist, it will be automatically moved to the "Watching" watchlist.
`playback`| if updated check the <i>Playback</i> endpoint with <i>date_from</i> parameter to get latest added playbacks or without the parameter to make a full sync.
`plantowatch`<br>`watching`<br>`completed`<br>`hold`<br>`dropped`| Items were added to one of the lists(exc. ratings automove function which won't update this fields) or some episodes were marked/unmarked<br><br>If updated check the <i>Get All Items</i> endpoint with <i>date_from</i> and <i>extended</i> parameters
`removed_from_list`| Check the <i>Get All Items</i> endpoint without <i>date_from</i> and <i>extended</i> parameters to determine which items were removed. <br>If removed items from the lists had ratings, they would be removed

Steps for **how to use it** with `date_from` field: 

1. Save all datetime values from this endpoint to your local/cloud storage of the APP
2. Fetch all data from <a href="#reference/sync/get-all-items">*/sync/get-all-items*</a> endpoint without `date_from` field
3. After some time, check this endpoint for any changes(compare the dates from this endpoint with you local saved copy, any specific date you need or just the main `"all": "2016-10-29T09:03:45Z"` date). 
4. On dates change 
    - use the date saved from your 1 step (ex. `"all": "2016-10-29T09:03:45Z"`) as `date_from` field value in <a href="#reference/sync/get-all-items">*/sync/get-all-items*</a> endpoint
    - save the new datetime values from this endpoint to your local/cloud storage
    - go to step 3

`date_from` field shows all items with the date greater(newer) than date_from field.

## Playback [/sync/playback/{type}]

A **playback** is a temporary session that stores viewing progress for a movie, TV show episode, or anime episode when playback is paused or stopped before completion. Playbacks are created automatically when users pause their viewing or stop watching before completing an item (less than 80% progress).

**Note:** Playbacks are **NOT** the same as Simkl's sync/watchlist endpoints. Playbacks are temporary pause/resume events and are **NOT saved to the user's watchlist**. They exist solely to track in-progress viewing sessions.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always use the [Activity API endpoint](#reference/sync/activities) first to check when you need to refresh sync or playback data. This endpoint provides timestamps for various categories including `playback` which indicates when playback sessions were last updated. By checking this endpoint first, you can optimize your application's performance and only sync playback data when changes have occurred.

### Relationship to Scrobbling

**Scrobbling** and **playbacks** work together to provide a complete viewing progress tracking system:

- **Scrobbling** (`/scrobble/start`, `/scrobble/pause`, `/scrobble/stop`) is the *action* of reporting real-time playback progress to the API
- **Playbacks** are *temporary records* created by scrobble pause/stop actions, storing pause points that can be resumed later
- **Sync/** endpoints (like `/sync/all-items`) are for *permanent* watchlist records that track what users have watched

**How they connect:**

1. When a user calls `/scrobble/pause`, it creates a **temporary playback record** with the current progress (not added to watchlist)
2. When a user calls `/scrobble/stop` with **less than 80%** progress, it creates a **temporary playback record** (not added to watchlist)
3. When a user calls `/scrobble/stop` with **80% or more** progress, the item is **marked as watched in the user's history/watchlist** (no resumable playback is created)
4. The `/sync/playback/{type}` endpoint retrieves these temporary playback records so apps can display "Continue Watching" lists
5. Users can resume a saved playback by calling `/scrobble/start` with the same item

**Key differences from sync watch history endpoints:**

- **Playbacks** (`/sync/playback`) = Temporary pause/resume events for in-progress viewing (NOT on watchlist)
- **Sync** (`/sync/all-items`) = Permanent watchlist records for completed items (≥80% progress)
- Only **one playback session per item** is stored (the most recent pause point)
- Playback sessions persist in the database until manually deleted or until `/scrobble/start` is called for the same item
- When retrieved via GET, sessions are automatically filtered out if the user has already watched the item after the playback was created (but remain in the database)

**Retention periods by subscription plan:**

Playback progress records are automatically retained based on the user's subscription level:

- **Free users**: 7 days retention
- **PRO users**: 30 days retention  
- **VIP users**: 90 days retention

These retention periods determine how long paused playback sessions remain available for the user to resume.

**Users can view and manage their saved playbacks at [https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/](https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/).**


### Error Responses
The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

| Status Code | Meaning | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `201 Created` | Success | The scrobble event was successfully created. |
| `204 No Content`| Success | The playback session was successfully deleted. |
| `400 Bad Request`| Client Error | The request was malformed. This can happen if you send a scrobble request without a `movie`, `show`, or `anime` object, or if there's a concurrency issue (see Rate Limiting). |
| `401 Unauthorized`| Client Error | The provided access token is invalid or has expired. |
| `404 Not Found` | Client Error | The requested item (movie, show, episode) could not be found on Simkl, or the URL is incorrect. |
| `409 Conflict` | Client Error | Returned by `/scrobble/stop` if you try to scrobble an item that was already marked as watched within the last hour. The response body will contain `watched_at` and `expires_at` timestamps. |

### Session Expiry & Storage
- **`start` sessions** have an `end_on` timestamp set to current time + remaining runtime, but are not automatically deleted when expired
- **`stop` sessions** have an `end_on` timestamp set to current time + 1 hour, but are not automatically deleted when expired  
- **`pause` sessions** have an `end_on` timestamp set to current time, but are not automatically deleted when expired
- All playback session types persist in the playback until manually removed via the `DELETE` endpoint, or by the user, or until they are replaced by the next scrobble update for that title

The `runtime in minutes` is determined as follows:
- **Movies**: Uses the movie's runtime from Simkl's database. Defaults to `90` minutes if not available.
- **TV Shows**: Uses the episode's specific runtime. Defaults to `45` minutes if not available.
- **Anime**: Uses the episode's specific runtime. Defaults to `25` minutes if not available.

### Concurrency & Rate Limiting
To ensure data integrity, the API processes scrobble events sequentially for each user. If you send multiple requests at once, they will be queued. A request may time out and fail with a `400 Bad Request` error if it has to wait too long for the previous one to complete. We recommend queuing scrobble events in your application and sending them one by one.


### Get Playback Sessions [GET]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>
Retrieves all paused playback sessions for the user. You can optionally filter by type by appending `/movie` or `/episode` to the path. Only one session per show/movie/anime is stored (the latest paused one).

`limit` is set to 10000 items by default, it's a maximum number of items you can retrive. 

`hide_watched` is true by default. All watched items with newer `watched date` than `paused date` will be hidden.

**When to use:** To get a list of items the user paused and can resume. Use this to display "Continue Watching" lists in your app.

**Behavior:** 
- Returns paused sessions created by `/scrobble/pause` or `/scrobble/stop` (<80% progress)
- Sessions for items the user has already watched (where their last watch time is after the session pause time) are automatically filtered out
- Sessions are ordered by pause time (newest first)
- Use the returned data to resume via `/scrobble/start`

**User Management:** Users can view and manage their paused sessions at [https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/](https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/) to manually delete unwanted sessions, mark items as watched, or use bulk selection tools for cleanup.

Note: Playback `id` field is a 64bit integer. `progress` is returned as a percentage (float number from 0 to 100, e.g., `0`, `45.5`, `75`, `100`). While you can POST in scrobble `75.00`, the response will always be `75`.

**Anime Episode Mapping:** Anime episodes return both AniDB episode numbers (`season`, `number`) and TVDB numbers (`tvdb_season`, `tvdb_number`) since Simkl maps between these different numbering systems.

+ Parameters
    + type (optional, string, `movies`) ... Filter by item type.
        + Values
            + `movies`
            + `episodes`
    + limit (optional, number) ... Slice your result to the first N items. Default: 10000
    + hide_watched (optional, boolean) ...Hide already watched episodes\movies. Default: true
        + Values
            + `true`
            + `false`
    + date_from (string, optional) ... Filter sessions from this date
    + date_to (string, optional) ... Filter sessions until this date

            ]

### Delete Playback [DELETE /sync/playback/{id}]
Deletes a specific paused playback session by its ID.

**When to use:** When a user no longer wants to resume a paused session (e.g., they finished watching elsewhere or changed their mind).

**Behavior:** Permanently removes the paused session. Returns 204 on success, 404 if the session doesn't exist or belongs to another user.

**Alternative:** Users can also manage their paused sessions manually at [https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/](https://simkl.com/my/history/playback-progress-manager/) without using the API, including bulk deletion and marking items as watched.

+ Parameters
    + id (number, required, in path) - The playback session ID to delete

## Get All Items [/sync/all-items/{type}/{status}{?date_from}]
#### ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️
For continuous sync, DO NOT use without fetching the **Activity** endpoint first.  
Always use `date_from` to sync only small changes. This avoids overloading the API server and helps keep it stable for all users. 

If you don't follow these rules, your client_id will be suspended.
[How to use Sync](#reference/sync/how-to-use-sync).
### Get all items in the user's watchlist [GET]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required &#10024; Full Info optional</h4>
Returns all items that user has in his watchlist (watching, plan to watch, dropped, completed), shows, anime, movies. 

Anime block has `anime_type` field, possible values are `tv`,`special`,`ova`,`movie`,`music video`,`ona`.

**Note:** If a user doesn't have anything in his watchlists, the response will be `null`

<h4>You can add to the URL:</h4>
Variable|Description
---|----
`extended=full`| adds a list of episodes user have watched
`extended=full_anime_seasons`| same as `full` + TVDB season and episode numbers for every Anime episode.  All Anime series including Completed watchlist has American style seasons map added `mapped_tvdb_seasons: [1,2]`.
`extended=simkl_ids_only`| minified response, returns only simkl IDs and slugs.
`extended=ids_only`| minified response, returns only all IDs and slugs without any additionl info.
`episode_watched_at=yes`| adds a time when user watched the episode as `watched_at` time for all episodes
`next_watch_info=yes`| adds more info about next to watch episodes
`memos=yes`| adds member's memo

**IMPORTANT:** Please keep in mind that adding more data to the request (using extended and episode_watched_at) makes the reply exponentially larger, + a few megabytes in most cases, so please use it only when needed and always with the use of `date_from` so that the server reply was very small and fast.

## Add Items to the history [/sync/history]
### Add items to watched/watching history [POST]
<h4>&#128274; Token Required</h4>

This endpoint lets you add items to a user's watched history. 

You can include movies, shows, episodes, or even specific seasons. The more details you provide (like title, year, and IDs), the easier it is for Simkl to match the item correctly.

- **By default, if you don’t specify watchlist status or episodes when adding a show:**
  1. **If the show hasn’t been released yet:** It will be added to your *Watching* list.
  2. **If the show is still airing:** All aired episodes will be marked as watched.
  3. **If the show has ended:** The show will be moved to your *Completed* list.
- **Using `watched_at`:** If you include a UTC datetime in `watched_at`, the item is recorded as watched at that time.
- **Marking as completed:** You can add `status: "completed"` to mark a show as completed. However, if the show is still airing, it will be added to your "watching" watchlist instead and all aired episodes will be marked as watched. The updated watchlist status will be returned in the response.
- **Moving to watching:** You can add `status: "watching"` to keep the show in the Watching watchlist without updating any episodes.
- **List of all supported statuses**: `watching`, `plantowatch`, `completed`, `dropped`, `hold`.


#### Handling Anime Seasons with TVDB/TMDB IDs
By default, anime seasons on Simkl are treated as separate series. To mark all seasons for an anime (when using only TVDB or TMDB IDs) starting from first season, include the flag:
```json
"use_tvdb_anime_seasons": true
```
in the item object.


Each media object should include as much data as possible—especially `title`, `year`, and `ids`—to help Simkl accurately detect the item. You can also include a `watched_at` field to specify the UTC datetime when the item was watched.


if `watched_at` UTC datetime is passed then all will be marked as watched in the past. 

Possible values in response for the `anime_type` key see [Standard Media Object](/#introduction/about-simkl-api/standard-media-objects) and for the `simkl_type` are `movie,tv,anime`


<h4>JSON POST DATA</h4>
Key|Type|Value
---|----|-----
`movies`|array| Array of `movie` objects ([see examples](#introduction/about-simkl-api/standard-media-objects)) 
`shows`|array| Array of `show` objects ([see examples](#introduction/about-simkl-api/standard-media-objects))
`episodes`|array| Array of `episode` objects ([see examples](#introduction/about-simkl-api/standard-media-objects))

<h4>MEDIA OBJECTS POST DATA</h4>
Key|Type|Value
---|----|-----
`item*`|object|movie, show or episode objects 
`watched_at`|datetime|UTC datetime when the item was watched

#### Moving between Watchlists 
Use  ['Add Item to the List'](#reference/sync/add-item-to-the-list/add-items-to-specific-list)  if you only need to move items between Watchlists.

+ Request (application/json) 
    Mark all Titan's seasons as watched. Will put the show into Completed watchlist if the show has ended. If the show is still airing will mark all aired episodes as watched and keep it in Watching watchlist.
